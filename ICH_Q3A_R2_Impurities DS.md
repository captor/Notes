## Q3A (R2) Impurities in New Drug Substance
### 1. Preamble
* By chemical syntheses only.
* Chemistry: classification and identification of impurities, report generation, list in specifications, and a brief discussion of analytical procedures.
* Safety: guidance for qualifying impurities, not present or present at substantially lower levels.
### 2. Classification of Impurities
* **Organic impurities**: from process and/or storage, include starting materials, by-pdt, intermediate, deg pdt, reagents, ligands, catalysts.
* **Inorganic impurities**: reagents, ligands, catalysts, metals, inorganic salts, others (filter aids, charcoal).
* **Residual solvents**: see Q3C.
* Excluded here are 1) contaminants 2) polymorphic forms 3) enantiomeric impurities.
### 3. Rationale for the Reporting and Control of Impurities
#### 3.1 Organic
* From synthesis, purification, and storage; associated with raw materials or possible degradation products.
* Test results of batches during development/proposed commercial process, stress testing.
* Structural characterization of impurities in DS at a level > ID threshold.
* Degraded pdts in stability studies at recommended storage conditions > ID threshold should be identified. 
* Potent, toxic, pharmacological effective imipurities: analytical procedures should be made at a level <= ID threshold.
