## Q3A (R2) Impurities in New Drug Substance
### 1. Preamble
* By chemical syntheses only.
* Chemistry: classification and identification of impurities, report generation, list in specifications, and a brief discussion of analytical procedures.
* Safety: guidance for qualifying impurities, not present or present at substantially lower levels.
### 2. Classification of Impurities
* Organic impurities: from process and/or storage, include starting materials, by-pdt, intermediate, deg pdt, reagents, ligands, catalysts.
* Inorganic impurities: reagents, ligands, catalysts, metals, inorganic salts, others (filter aids, charcoal).
* Residual solvents: see Q3C.
* Excluded here are 1) contaminants 2) polymorphic forms 3) enantiomeric impurities.
