# ICH Quility Guidelines
## Q3A (R2) Impurities in New Drug Substance
### 1. Preamble
* From chemical syntheses only.
* Chemistry: classification and identification of impurities, report generation, list in specifications, and a brief discussion of analytical procedures.
* Safety: guidance for qualifying impurities, not present or present at substantially lower levels.
### 2. Classification of Impurities
* **Organic impurities**: from process and/or storage, include starting materials, by-pdt, intermediate, deg pdt, reagents, ligands, catalysts.
* **Inorganic impurities**: reagents, ligands, catalysts, metals, inorganic salts, others (filter aids, charcoal).
* **Residual solvents**: see Q3C.
* Excluded here are 1) contaminants 2) polymorphic forms 3) enantiomeric impurities.
### 3. Rationale for the Reporting and Control of Impurities
#### 3.1 Organic
* From synthesis, purification, and storage; associated with raw materials or possible degradation products.
* Test results of batches during development/proposed commercial process, stress testing.
* Structural characterization of impurities in DS at a level > ID threshold.
* Degraded pdts in stability studies at recommended storage conditions > ID threshold should be identified. 
* Potent, toxic, pharmacological effective imipurities: analytical procedures should be made at a level <= ID threshold. 
### 4. Analytical Procedures
* Differences in the methods used during development and commercial pdt should be discussed.
* QL <= the reporting threshold.
### 5. Reporting Impurity Content of Batches
* Results should be presented numerically.
* Any impurity > the reporting threshold and total impurities should be reported. All impurities > the reporting threshold should be summed as total impurities. 
* < 1.0%: two decimal places (0.13%)
* > 1.0%: one decimal place (1.3%)
* Rounded using conventional rules
* The report include: batch identity and size, date, site, process, impurity content (individual and total), use, reference to analytical procedure.
### 6. Listing of Impurities in Specifications
* Specified impurities, can be identified or unidentified
* Unusually potent, toxix or pharmacological effects, the Q/DL should be commensurate with the level at which the impurities should be controlled. 
* Specified, unidentified impurities, should be referred by (unidentified, unidentified with relative retention of 0.9).
* Acceptance criteria < the level justified by safety data, consistent with the level of manufacturing process/analytical capability.
* _Organic_: spec. ID im, spec. un-ID im, un-spec. im with an acceptance criterion of NMT the ID threshold, total im; _Residual solvents_; _Inorganic_.
### 7. Qualification of Impurities
* Acquire and evaluate data that establishes the safety of an individual impurity or an impurity profile at the levels specified.
### 8. Glossary
* **Chemical Development Studies**: to scale-up, optimize and validate the manufacturing process for NDS.
* **Extraneous Contaminant**: impurity arise from outside of the manufacturing process.
* **Identified Impurity**: known structure
* **Unidentified Impurity**: structure not know, solely defined by qualitative analytical properties.
* **Identification Threshold**: a limit above which an impurity should be ID.
* **Impurity Profile**: a description of the ID and un-ID impurities.
* **Polymorphic Forms**: different crystalline forms of the same DS. Solvation or hydration pdts (pseudo-polymorphs) and amorphous forms.
* **Potential Impurity**: theorectically may arise from process or storage
* **Qualification Threshold**: A limit above which an impurity should be qualified. 
* **Reporting Threshold**: A limit above which an impurity should be reported. Same as reporting level in Q2B. 
* **Specified Impurity**: individually listed and limited witha specific acceptance criterion
* **Unspecified Impurity**: limited by a general acceptance criterion, not individually listed.
