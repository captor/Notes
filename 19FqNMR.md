# 19F qNMR
- A full scan of reference and analytes. Determine the chemical shifts (CR, C1, C2 ... Cn). 
- Each sample requires n+1 measurements because the chemical shift differences are usually larger than 20 ppm in 19F NMR.
- 

## To begin
- **Load sample**
- **Change the cables**: unscrew both green and yellow cables, and then screw the yellow cable into the green plug. Basically move the top cable down one position. The filter on the green cable has to be removed as well. 
- **VT**: `edte` target T 298 K, Max heating 3%, gas flow 800 L/h, clink heat on, monitor the temperature.

## 90 degree pulse measurement

- `new`, `rpar` -> search for \*19\*

## T1 measurement




- **VT off**: `edte` turn off heater, *confiqure* -> click load config -> VT_off to reset the default setting
- **Change the cables back**
