## Q1B Stability Testing: Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products
### 1. General
* A. single batch of material, systematic approach: i) Tests on the drug substance; ii) Tests on the exposed drug product outside of the immediate pack; iii) Tests on the drug product in the immediate pack; iv) Tests on the drug product in the marketing pack. 
* B. Light Sources: <_option 1_> D65 is the internationally recognized std for outdoor daylight (ISO 10977, 1993). ID65 is the equivalent indoor indirect daylight std. Appropriate filter should be fitted to eliminate significant radiation below 320 nm. <_option 2_> A cool white fluorescent lamp as specified in ISO 10977(1993) and a near UV fluorescent lamp ranging 320-400 nm with a max. energy at 350-370 nm; a significant proportion of UV should be in both bands of 320-360 and 360-400 nm.
* C. Procedure: 1.2 million lux hours and 200 watt hours/sq meter exposure, validated chemical actinometric system to ensure specified light expresure, calibrated radiometers/lus meters to monitor, dark controls should be placed alongside with samples to evaluate thermally induced change,  
### 2. Drug Substance 
* Forced degradation testing: to evaluate the overall photosensitivity.  
* Confirmatory testing: to provide information for handling, packaging and labeling.
* A. Presentation of Samples:
