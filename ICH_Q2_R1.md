## Q2 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology
## Part 1
### 2. Types of Analytical Procedures to be Validated
* Identification tests; Quantitative tests for impurities' content; Limit tests for the control of impurities; Quantitative tests of the active moiety in samples. 
* **Identification tests**: to ensure the identity, compare property to reference std.
* **Impurities testing**: can be either a quantitative or a limit test, to reflect the purity characteristics of the sample. 
* **Assay procedures**: to measure the analyte present in a given sample, a quantitative measurement of the major component(s).
* Typical validation characteristics: **_Accuracy, Precision (Repeatability, Intermediate Precision), Specificity, Detection Limit (DL), Quantitation Limit (QL), Linearity and Range._**
* It should be noted that robustness is not listed in the table but should be considered.
* Revalidation: changes in the synthesis, drug product composition, analytical procedure.
### Glossary
* **Analytical procedure**: refers to the way of performing the analysis, including samples, reference std, reagents preparations, apparatus, calibration curve, formulae.
* **Specificity**: to assess the analyte in the presence of components, imipurities, degradants, matrix. _Identification_ -> to ensure the identity; _Purity tests_ -> to allow an accurate statement of the content of impurities (related substances, heavy metals, residual solvents); _Assay (content or potency)_ -> to allow an accurate statement on the content or potency.
* **Accuracy**
