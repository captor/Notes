## Q2 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology
## Part 1
### 2. Types of Analytical Procedures to be Validated
* Identification tests; Quantitative tests for impurities' content; Limit tests for the control of impurities; Quantitative tests of the active moiety in samples. 
* **Identification tests**: to ensure the identity, compare property to reference std.
* **Impurities testing**: can be either a quantitative or a limit test, to reflect the purity characteristics of the sample. 
* **Assay procedures**: to measure the analyte present in a given sample, a quantitative measurement of the major component(s).
* Typical validation characteristics: **_Accuracy, Precision (Repeatability, Intermediate Precision), Specificity, Detection Limit (DL), Quantitation Limit (QL), Linearity and Range._**
