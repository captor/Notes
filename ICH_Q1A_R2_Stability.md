## Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products
### 2.1. Drug Substance
* 2.1.2. Stress Testing: temperature, humidity, pH, oxidation, photostability
* 2.1.3. Selection of Batches: at least 3 primary batches, manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route 
* 2.1.4. Container Closure System
* 2.1.5. Spec: Stab should cover the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied.  
* 2.1.6. Testing Frequency: for long term (12 months), every 3 months in 1st year, 6 months in 2nd year; accelarated condition, min. 3 time points; intermediate condition, min. 4 time points.
* 2.1.7. Storage Conditions: general use, refrigerator (long and accelarated), freezer (long), below -20 (case by case).
* 2.1.8. Stability Commitment
* 2.1.9. Evaluation: physical, chemical, biological and microbiological tests; 95% one-sided confidence limit for the mean curve intersects the acceptance criterion. 
* 2.1.10. Statements/Labeling: specific instructions should be provided, particularly for drug substances that cannot tolerate freezing. Terms such as "ambient conditions" or "room temperature" should be avoid. 
### 2.2. Drug Product
* 2.2.2. Photostability Testing: ICH Q1B
* 2.2.3. Selection of Batches: at least 3, 2 of 3 should be at least pilot scale batches and the 3rd can be smaller, if justified. Where possible, batches of the drug product should be manufactured by using different batches of the drug substance. Stability studies should be performed on each individual strength and container size of the drug product unless bracketing or matrixing is applied. 
* 2.2.4. Container Closer System: container system proposed for marketing (2nd packaging and label)
* 2.2.5. Spec: Stab test should cover the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes, preservative content (e.g., antioxidant, antimicrobial preservative), and functionality tests (e.g., for a dose delivery system). 
* 2.2.6. Testing Frequency: see above.
* 2.2.7. Storage Conditions: general use, packaged in impermeable containers, packaged in semi-permeable container. In general use, "significant change" is defined as: 1. a 5% change or fail to meet potency; 2. degradded products exceed acceptance criterion; 3. fail to meet appearance, physical attributes, and functionality test; 4. fail to meet pH; 5. fail to meet dissolution for 12 dosage units.
* 2.2.8-10. See above
