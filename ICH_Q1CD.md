## Q1C Stability Testing for New Dosage Forms 
### 1. General
* after the original submission for new drug substances and products.
### 2. New Dosage Forms
* different product type, but same active substance. 
* different administration route (e.g., oral to parenteral), new specific functionality/delivery systems (e.g., immediate release tablet to modified release tablet) and different dosage forms of the same administration route (e.g., capsule to tablet, solution to suspension).
* a reduced stability database at submission time (e.g., 6 months accelerated and 6 months long term data from ongoing studies) may be acceptable in certain justified cases.
