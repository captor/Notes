### 3 Glossary
* **Accelerated testing**: increase the rate of chemical degradation or physical change. 
* **Bracketing**: The design assumes that the stability of any intermediate levels is represented by the stability of the extremes tested.
* **Climatic zones**: The four zones in the world that are distinguished by their characteristic prevalent annual climatic conditions.
* **Commitment batches**: Production batches, for which the stability studies are initiated or completed _post approval_ through a commitment.
* **Container closure system**: Or packaging system, the sum of packaging components.
* **Dosage form**: A pharmaceutical product type (e.g., tablet, capsule, solution, cream). 
* **Drug product**: The final immediate packaging intended for marketing. 
* **Drug substance**: The unformulated drug substance. 
* **Excipient**: Anything other than the drug substance in the dosage form. 
* **Formal stability studies**: Long term and accelerated (and intermediate) studies undertaken on primary and/or commitment batches according to a prescribed stability protocol to establish or confirm the re-test period of a drug substance or the shelf life of a drug product.
* **Impermeable containers**: Containers that provide a permanent barrier to the passage of gases or solvents. 
* **Intermediate testing**: 30°C/65% RH, moderately increase the rate of chemical degradation or physical changes. 
* **Long term testing**: Stability studies under the recommended storage condition for the re-test period or shelf life proposed (or approved) for labeling.
* **Mass balance**: Add the assay value and levels of degradation products to see how closely these add up to 100% of the initial value.
* **Matrixing**: The design of a stability schedule such that a selected subset of the total number of possible samples for all factor combinations is tested at a specified time point. For example, different batches, different strengths, different sizes of the same container closure system, different container closure systems. 
* **Mean kinetic temperature**: A single derived temperature that, if maintained over a defined period of time, affords the same thermal challenge to a drug substance or drug product as would be experienced over a range of both higher and lower temperatures for an equivalent defined period. The mean kinetic temperature is higher than the arithmetic mean temperature and takes into account the Arrhenius equation. formula of J. D. Haynes (J. Pharm. Sci., 60:927-929, 1971)
* **New molecular entity**: An active pharmaceutical substance not previously contained in any drug product registered with the national or regional authority concerned. 
* **Pilot scale batch**: For solid oral dosage forms, a pilot scale is generally, at a minimum, one-tenth that of a full production scale or 100,000 tablets or capsules, whichever is the larger. 
* **Primary batch**: drug substance: at least a pilot scale batch. rug product, 2 of 3 should be at least pilot scale batch, and the 3rd one can be smaller. 
* **Re-test date**: The date after which samples should be examined to ensure that the material is still in compliance.  
* **Re-test period**: The period of time during which the drug substance is expected to remain within its specification and, therefore, can be used in the manufacture of a given drug product, provided that the drug substance has been stored under the defined conditions. 
* **Semi-permeable containers**: Containers that allow the passage of solvent, usually water, while preventing solute loss. 
* **Shelf life (also referred to as expiration dating period)**  
* **Specification – Release**: The combination of physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests and acceptance criteria that determine the suitability of a drug product at the time of its release. 
* **Specification - Shelf life** :The combination of physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests and acceptance criteria that determine the suitability of a drug substance throughout its re-test period, or that a drug product should meet throughout its shelf life. 
* **Storage condition tolerances**: The acceptable variations in temperature and relative humidity of storage facilities for formal stability studies.
* **Stress testing (drug substance)**: normally carried out under more severe conditions than those used for accelerated testing. 
* **Stress testing (drug product)**: include photostability testing (see ICH Q1B) and specific testing on certain products, (e.g., metered dose inhalers, creams, emulsions, refrigerated aqueous liquid products). 
* **Supporting data**: Data, other than those from formal stability studies, include (1) stability data on early synthetic route, small scale batches of materials, investigational formulations not proposed for marketing, related formulations, and product presented in containers and closures other than those proposed for marketing; (2) information regarding test results on containers; and (3) other scientific rationales.
