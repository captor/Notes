## Q3C (R6) Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents
### 2. Scope 
* A cumulative method may be used to calculate the residual solvent levels of DP. If the calculation results <= that recommended, no testing need to be considered.
### 3. General Principles
#### 3.1 Classification of Residual Solvents by Risk Assessment
* **Tolarable daily intake** (TDI) is used by the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS).
* **Acceptable daily intake** (ADI) is used by the World Health Organization (WHO).
* **Permitted daily exposure** (PDE) is defined as a pharmaceutically acceptable intake of residual solvents.
* **Appendix 1**: _Class 1 - avoided_, _Class 2 - limited_, _Class 3 - low toxic potential_: PDE of 50 mg or more per day.
#### 3.3 Options for Describing Limits of Class 2 Solvents
* **Option 1**: Concentration limit (ppm) = 1000 x PDE (mg/day) / dose (g/day); assuming a product mass of 10 g administered daily.
* **Option 2**: Use PDE and calculate based on the known Max. daily dose. May be applied by adding the amounts of a residual solvent present in each component. The sum should be less than PDE.
