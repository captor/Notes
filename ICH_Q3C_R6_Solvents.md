## Q3C (R6) Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents
### 1. Introduction
* Unacceptable toxicities (Class 1, Table 1) should be avoided, unless strongly justified in a risk-benefit assessment. 
* Less severe toxicity (Class 2, Table 2) should be limited.
* Less toxic solvents (Class 3, Table 3) should be used where practical. 
* **Appendix 1**
### 2. Scope 
* A cumulative method may be used to calculate the residual solvent levels of DP. If the calculation results <= that recommended, no testing need to be considered.
* **Appendix 2**
### 3. General Principles
#### 3.1 Classification of Residual Solvents by Rist Assessment
