# ICH Quality Gudelines## Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products### 2.1. Drug Substance* 2.1.2. Stress Testing: temperature, humidity, pH, oxidation, photostability* 2.1.3. Selection of Batches: at least 3 primary batches, manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route * 2.1.4. Container Closure System* 2.1.5. Spec: Stab should cover the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied.Â  * 2.1.6. Testing Frequency: for long term (12 months), every 3 months in 1st year, 6 months in 2nd year; accelarated condition, min. 3 time points; intermediate condition, min. 4 time points.* 2.1.7. Storage Conditions: general use, refrigerator (long and accelarated), freezer (long), below -20 (case by case).* 2.1.8. Stability Commitment* 2.1.9. Evaluation: physical, chemical, biological and microbiological tests; 95% one-sided confidence limit for the mean curve intersects the acceptance criterion. * 2.1.10. Statements/Labeling: specific instructions should be provided, particularly for drug substances that cannot tolerate freezing. Terms such as "am
