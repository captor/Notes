## Q1C Stability Testing for New Dosage Forms 
### 1. General
* after the original submission for new drug substances and products.
### 2. New Dosage Forms
* different product type, but same active substance. 
* different administration route (e.g., oral to parenteral), new specific functionality/delivery systems (e.g., immediate release tablet to modified release tablet) and different dosage forms of the same administration route (e.g., capsule to tablet, solution to suspension).
* a reduced stability database at submission time (e.g., 6 months accelerated and 6 months long term data from ongoing studies) may be acceptable in certain justified cases.

## Q1D Bracketing and Matrixing Designs for Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
### 2.3 Bracketing
#### 2.3.1 Design Factors (variables)
* 2.3.1.1. Strength: (1) capsules (2) tablets (3) oral solutions that differ only in minor excipients. In cases where different excipients are used among strengths, bracketing generally should not be applied. 
* 2.3.1.2. Container Closure Sizes and/or Fills: container wall thickness, closure geometry, surface area to volume ratio, headspace to volume ratio, water vapour permeation rate or oxygen permeation rate per dosage unit or unit fill volume. 
#### 2.3.2 Design Considerations and Potential Risks
* If the stability of the extremes is shown to be different, the intermediates should be considered no more stable than the least stable extreme (i.e., the shelf life for the intermediates should not exceed that for the least stable extreme).
### 2.4 Matrixing
* see example table. 
* one-half reduction: eliminates one in every two time points from the full study design.
" one-third reduction: eliminates one in every three.  
* knowledge of data variability, expected stab. of the pdt, availability of supporting data, stab. differences among factors, number of factor combinations in the study.
* Potential Risk: linearity is assumed and full testing of all factor combinations would still be performed at both the initial and the last time point prior to submission.
