# ICH Quality Gudelines
## Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products
### 2.1. Drug Substance
* 2.1.2. Stress Testing: temperature, humidity, pH, oxidation, photostability
* 2.1.3. Selection of Batches: at least 3 primary batches, manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route 
* 2.1.4. Container Closure System
* 2.1.5. Spec
* 2.1.6. Testing Frequency: for long term (12 months), every 3 months in 1st year, 6 months in 2nd year; accelarated condition, min. 3 time points; intermediate condition, min. 4 time points.
* 2.1.7. Storage Conditions: general use, refrigerator (long and accelarated), freezer (long), below -20 (case by case).
* 2.1.8. Stability Commitment
* 2.1.9. Evaluation: physical, chemical, biological and microbiological tests; 95% one-sided confidence limit for the mean curve intersects the acceptance criterion. 
* 2.1.10. Statements/Labeling: specific instructions should be provided, particularly for drug substances that cannot tolerate freezing. Terms such as "ambient conditions" or "room temperature" should be avoid. 
### 2.2. Drug Product
* 2.2.2. Photostability Testing: ICH Q1B
* 2.2.3. Selection of Batches: at least 3, 2 of 3 should be at least pilot scale batches and the 3rd can be smaller, if justified. Where possible, batches of the drug product should be manufactured by using different batches of the drug substance. Stability studies should be performed on each individual strength and container size of the drug product unless bracketing or matrixing is applied. 
* 2.2.4. Container Closer System
