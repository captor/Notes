## Q1B Stability Testing: Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products
### 1. General
* A. single batch of material, systematic approach: i) drug substance; ii) outside of the immediate pack; iii) in the immediate pack; iv) in the marketing pack. 
* B. Light Sources: <_option 1_> D65 is std for outdoor daylight (ISO 10977, 1993). ID65 is the indoor indirect daylight std. <_option 2_> A cool white fluorescent lamp as specified in ISO 10977(1993) and a near UV fluorescent lamp ranging 320-400 nm with a max. energy at 350-370 nm; a significant proportion of UV should be in both bands of 320-360 and 360-400 nm.
* C. Procedure: 1.2 million lux hours and 200 watt hours/sq meter exposure, validated chemical actinometric system to ensure specified light expresure, calibrated radiometers/lus meters to monitor, dark controls should be placed alongside with samples to evaluate thermally induced change.  
### 2. Drug Substance 
* Forced degradation testing: to evaluate the overall photosensitivity.  
* Confirmatory testing: to provide information for handling, packaging and labeling.
* A. Presentation of Samples
* B. Analysis of Samples: examine physical properties changes and degradants
* C. Judgement of Results: The forced degradation studies should be designed to provide suitable information to develop and validate test methods for the confirmatory studies. Resolve and detect degradants that appear during the confirmatory studies. Provide info, if light resistant packaging is needed.
### 3. Drug Product
* tests carried out in a sequential manner, from the fully exposed -> immediate pack -> marketing pack. 
* A-C. see above
### 4. Annex
* A. Quinine Chemical Actinometry
