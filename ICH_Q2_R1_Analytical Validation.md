## Q2 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology
## Part 1: Text
### 2. Types of Analytical Procedures to be Validated
* Identification tests; Quantitative tests for impurities' content; Limit tests for the control of impurities; Quantitative tests of the active moiety in samples. 
* **Identification tests**: to ensure the identity, compare property to reference std.
* **Impurities testing**: can be either a quantitative or a limit test, to reflect the purity characteristics of the sample. Impurities can be degraded compounds.  
* **Assay procedures**: to measure the analyte present in a given sample, a quantitative measurement of the major component(s).
* Typical validation characteristics: **_Accuracy, Precision (Repeatability, Intermediate Precision), Specificity, Detection Limit (DL), Quantitation Limit (QL), Linearity and Range._**
* It should be noted that robustness is not listed in the table but should be considered.
* Revalidation: changes in the synthesis, drug product composition, analytical procedure.
### Glossary
* **Analytical procedure**: refers to the way of performing the analysis, including samples, reference std, reagents preparations, apparatus, calibration curve, formulae.
* **Specificity**: to assess the analyte in the presence of components, imipurities, degradants, matrix. _Identification_ -> to ensure the identity; _Purity tests_ -> to allow an accurate statement of the content of impurities (related substances, heavy metals, residual solvents); _Assay (content or potency)_ -> to allow an accurate statement on the content or potency.
* **Accuracy**: trueness, the closeness of agreement between the true value (accepted ref.) and the found value.
* **Precision**: _Repeatability_ -> intra-assay precision; _Intermediate precision_ -> within-lab variations; _Reproducibility_ -> between different labs; precision of an analytical method is expressed as the variance, std dev or coefficient of variation.
* **Detection Limit**: the lowest amount can be detected but not necessarily quantitated. 
* **Quantitation Limit**: the lowest amount can be _quantitatively_ determined with suitable precision and accuracy; used particularly for the determination of impurities and/or degradation products. 
* **Linearity**: directly proportional to the concn.
* **Range**: the interval between the upper and lower concn. with precision, accuracy and linearity.
* **Robustness**: capacity to remain unaffected by small variations in method

## Part 2: Methodology
### 1. Specificity
* 1.1. Identification: discriminate between compounds of closely related structures
* 1.2. Assay and Impurity Tests: specificity can be demonstrated by the resolution of the two components which elute closest to each other
* 1.2.1 Impurities are available: spiking pure substances with impurities and/or excipients 
* 1.2.2 Impurities are not available: comparing the test resuls of samples containing impurities or degradation pdts to a second well-characterized procedure. Compare results from two assays and the impurity profiles.
### 2. Linearity
* Can be demonstrated by dilution of a std stock and/or separate weighing.
* Regression line by the method of least squares: correlation coefficient, y-intercept, slope, and residual sum of squares. A plot should be included. 
* A min. of 5 concn. is recommended.
### 3. Range
* For DS/DP: 80-120 percent of the test concn.
* For content uniformity, mim. 70 to 130 percent of the test concn., unless a wider range based on the nature of the dosage form, is justtified.
* For dissolution: +/-20% over the specified range. If the spec. for a controlled released pdt cover a region from 20% after 1 h, up to 90%, after 24 h, the validated range would be 0-110% of the label claim. 
* For the determination of an impurity: from the reporting level to 120% of the spec.
* For potent/toxic impurities: the detection/quantitation limit should be commensurate with the controlled level. 
* If only 100% std is used, linearity should cover the range from the reporting level to 120% of the spec.
### 4. Accuracy
#### 4.1. Assay
*  **Drug Substance**: a) analyze with ref. material; b) compare the 1st analysis to the 2nd well-characterized procudure; c) maya be inferred once precision, linearity and specificity have been established.
* **Drug Product**: see above.
#### 4.2. Impurities (Quantitation)
* Assessed on samples spiked with known impurities.
* Impurities not available: compare results from an independent procedure.
#### 4.3. Recommended Data
* Min. 9 determinations over a min. of 3 concn. levels covering the specified range (3 concn/3 replicates).
### 5. Precision
* Repeatability: Min. 9 determinations covering the specified range or min. of 6 determinations at 100% of the test concn.
* Intermediate Precision: Typical variations: days, analysts, equipments. 
* Reproducibility: Inter-lab trial
* Recommended Data: std dev, relative std dev (coefficient of variation) and confidence interval should be reported. 
### 6. Detection Limit (DL)
* Based on visual evaluation, signal-to-noise (only to those exhibit baseline noise)
* Based on std dev of the response and the slope: DL = 3.3*(std dev) / slope. The estimate of std dev can be, std dev of the blank or residual std dev of a regression line or std dev of y-intercept. 
* Recommended Data: if based on visual or S/N ratio, presentation of the relevant chromatograms is considered acceptable.
### 7. Quantitation Limit (QL)
* Based on visual evaluation, S/N ratio (typically 10:1).
* Based on std dev of the response and the slope: Ql = 10*(std dev) / slope. The estimate of std dev can be, (see above).
### 8. Robustness
* Typical variations: stability of analytical solns, extraction time.
* LC variation: pH in the MP, MP composition, different columns (lots and/or suppliers), temperature, flow rate. Later three also apply to GC.
### 9. System Suitability Testing
